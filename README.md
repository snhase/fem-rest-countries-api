### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap - CSS Framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap documentation on grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/) - This helped me understand Bootstap's powerful mobile-first flexbox grid system to make the app responsive. 
- [Bootstrap color mode for toggling theme](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/customize/color-modes/) - Bootstrap supports color modes as of v5.3.0, using it you can implement your own color mode toggle. By default it provides light and dark mode. Color modes can be toggled globally on the `<html>` element, or on specific components and elements, using the `data-bs-theme` attribute. I'd definitely recommend this easy to use feature to anyone who wants to add theme switcher to their app.
